# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where is my data stored?
All app data (settings, API keys, chat history, attachments) is stored locally on your device by default.

## Do you collect analytics?
No. The app does not include analytics or advertising SDKs.

## Why can’t I send images?
Ensure the selected provider/model supports vision. Some models are text‑only.

## I’m hitting rate limits or errors
Provider rate limits vary. Reduce message frequency, or change models. Check provider status pages.

## How do I use a proxy or custom base URL?
Use Providers → Custom base URL and headers. See Custom Requests for details.

## Can I export or back up chats?
Yes. Use backup options (e.g., local export or WebDAV if configured).

## How to reset memory?
Disable memory in Assistant, or clear stored summaries for that assistant/chat.
