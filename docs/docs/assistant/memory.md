# Memory

Memory helps the assistant remember key facts across chats or sessions.

## How It Works
- When enabled, the app summarizes salient facts and stores them locally.
- Summaries are fed back to the model as context, within the token limit.

## Controls
- Enable/disable per assistant.
- Clear memory for an assistant or a specific chat from the UI.

## Privacy
Memory is stored locally. It is never uploaded unless you choose to back up your data.
