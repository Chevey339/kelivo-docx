# Assistant Basics

Assistants bundle default behavior so you can reuse settings across chats.

## Core Fields
- Name & Avatar: Identify your assistant.
- Default Provider & Model: Pick the service/model used unless overridden per chat.
- Temperature / Top‑p / Top‑k: Control response style and diversity.
- System Prompt: Define role and instructions.
- Tools: Enable TTS, web search providers, or MCP tool calling.

## Per‑Chat Overrides
You can override model or parameters for a specific chat without changing the assistant defaults.

## Memory Toggle
Enable memory to let the assistant build summaries and recall persistent context. See Memory for details.
