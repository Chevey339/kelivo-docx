# MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP lets Kelivo call external tools over a standard protocol.

## Setup
- Enable MCP in your assistant or global settings.
- Add one or more MCP servers (address/credentials per server docs).

## Usage
- The model may propose tool calls; you can review and approve execution.
- Tool results are returned to the model for follow‑up reasoning.

## Security
- Only connect to MCP servers you trust.
- Review tool permissions and data flow before enabling.

Refer to your MCP server documentation for installation and schemas.
