# Privacy Policy


## Summary
- We do not collect personal data.
- Your API keys and settings are stored on your device.
- Your chat content and files are stored locally unless you choose to back them up (e.g., to your own WebDAV).
- If you enable third‑party AI/search providers, your prompts and selected files are sent to those providers to fulfill your request.
- We do not use analytics or third‑party advertising SDKs.

## Data We Handle

### On‑device data
- App settings (theme, language, providers configuration)
- API keys for providers you add
- Chat history and attachments (images/documents)

All of the above are stored locally on your device. You can delete them at any time by clearing app data or using in‑app tools.

### Data sent to third‑party providers (optional)
If you configure providers (e.g., OpenAI, Google Gemini, Anthropic, Zhipu, Exa, Tavily, LinkUp, Brave, SearXNG), we transmit your request content to the selected provider to perform the requested operation (AI inference or search). This may include:
- Text prompts and conversation context
- Images or files you choose to send

Provider use of data is governed by each provider’s own privacy policy and terms. Kelivo does not control, retain, or sell this data.

## Permissions
- Camera: capture images to send or set avatars
- Microphone: record audio when capturing videos in the media picker flow
- Photos: select or save images (e.g., avatars, chat images)

Permissions are only requested when you use a related feature.

## Children’s Privacy
Kelivo is not directed to children under 13. If you believe we inadvertently handled a child’s data, contact us to remove it.

## Security
We use the platform’s secure storage and HTTPS to protect your data in transit to providers. Keep your API keys safe. Revoke keys with your provider if needed.

## Your Choices
- Use the app without adding any provider keys; some features (e.g., local Bing search) may still work.
- Add/remove providers at any time.
- Export or delete your data and backups.
